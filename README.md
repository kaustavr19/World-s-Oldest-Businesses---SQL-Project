# World's Oldest-Businesses_SQL-Project
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. 
Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years. 
In this project I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when they were founded and which industries they belong to.

<h3>Project Tasks</h3>
1. The oldest business in the world
2. How many businesses were founded before 1000?
3. Which businesses were founded before 1000?
4. Exploring the categories
5. Counting the categories
6. Oldest business by continent
